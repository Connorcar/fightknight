change parry to 2/2 damage

nerf block's fp gain

enemy max hp multiplier into a variable

reset player's block count on new fight

when new fight begins change parry text to PARRY

player can use unlimited FP during between fight phase

pressing "next fight" after fight #2 makes you parry instead of resetting the fight

parry calculation seems to be wrong for when player's dmg is buffed and enemy parries an attack
