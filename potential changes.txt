change parry to 2/2 damage

enemy max hp multiplier into a variable

reset player's block count on new fight

player can use unlimited FP during between fight phase

parry calculation seems to be wrong for when player's dmg is buffed and enemy parries an attack

make enemies also deal more damage each round
